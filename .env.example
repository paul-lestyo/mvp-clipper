# Performance Tuning (Optional - defaults provided in docker-compose.yml)
# Uncomment and adjust these values if running outside Docker or need custom tuning

# OpenCV Performance
# OPENCV_OPENCL_RUNTIME=          # Empty to disable OpenCL overhead
# OMP_NUM_THREADS=2               # Limit OpenMP threads (adjust based on CPU cores)

# Go Runtime Performance
# GOMEMLIMIT=1800MiB              # Soft memory limit for Go GC (set to ~90% of container memory limit)
# GOGC=100                        # GC percentage (100 = default, lower = more frequent GC, higher = less frequent)

# YuNet Face Detection
# MODEL_PATH=models/face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx  # Path to YuNet model (default is fine)

# Video Processing
# FFMPEG_THREADS=0                # 0 = auto-detect optimal threads
# MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=2           # Maximum concurrent video processing jobs

# Notes:
# - For production, use a secrets manager instead of .env files
# - Resource limits in docker-compose.yml: 2 CPUs, 2GB RAM (adjust as needed)
# - Health check endpoint: http://localhost:8080/health
